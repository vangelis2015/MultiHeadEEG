# ðŸ§  SSVEP EEG Pipeline

This repository provides a modular and extensible PyTorch pipeline for training, validating, and fine-tuning neural models on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) EEG data. The architecture is designed for reproducible research, supporting multi-head Transformer-based models, per-subject fine-tuning, and advanced loss functions such as Deep CCA and reconstruction loss.

---

##  Features

-  Two-stage training (global pretraining + subject-specific fine-tuning)
-  Multi-head Transformer encoder for temporal and spatial EEG representation
-  Integration of auxiliary objectives (reconstruction, Deep CCA)
-  Block-based evaluation (e.g., Leave-One-Block-Out)
-  Modular design for training/validation loops and model customization
-  Easy configuration via `config.py`
-  Compatibility with MLflow and experiment tracking tools
